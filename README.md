# About DevNotes
DevNotes serves as a simple repository for all my notes regarding Web Development.  It's not intended to be a complete or exhaustive collection on the topic, but rather a place to file, organize and track the many disparate - yet related - items I've learned or am learning.  There is such a seemingly endless number of different techniques, practices, languages and software packages to learn and stay current on - I've decided there's value in cataloging them here.  

## Intent
I've discovered a tendency to forget about what I've already learned if I don't take notes.  Not only is it nice to be able to refer to notes to refresh my understanding, but I believe the act of taking notes itself enhances my learning.  

Perhaps more importantly, the act of taking notes in editor and for the web gives me the opportunity to re-enforce the basic practices I'm learning about.  Maintaining this repository requires me to do daily work in the editor, browser, terminal, etc.  It keeps my basic skills from atrophying and my git-fu strong, even if I'm not currently engaged in a larger project.  

I don't know if this repository would have any value for another student of Web Development.  These are after all my personal notes and catered to my needs and interests.  I expect others might benefit more from creating their own repositories.  But there's no harm in hosting it publicly and no need to privatize it as it's mostly just a collection of public information from other sources.  If you do find anything useful here, feel free to take it and make it your own.
